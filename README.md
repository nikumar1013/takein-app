## Feature List:

- Loading Screen – A loading screen while app functionality registers
- Home page – A page that displays a users feed and allows navigation to other pages
- Login page – A page that lets a user login to their specific account
- Settings – A page that lets a user configure the app to their liking, 2 settings are dark mode, search radius (how many miles away you want to search for places)
- Search page — allows user to search for events near them (based on category, proximity, and timing)
- Profile pages — allows the user to click on any user and see their interests, age, and reviews
- Review Page — form that allows them to write a review about a specific profile 
- In App Messaging — allows communication between the host and the guest
- Event Creation Page — Will allow hosts to create events and post it online
- Navigation UI — allows users to navigate between profiles/create events page/home/search page
- Online — Users will be able to view/post events online

## Development Plan: 
- Alpha Skeleton Frontend & Skeleton Backend
  - We will set up the UI for all the pages and implement the navigation UI. We will also start implementing some basic backend functionality.
- Beta Fairly complete Frontend & partially complete Backend & skeleton networking
  - Set up the database 
  - Fully implement the frontend for every page, and implement the backend for loading screen, login page, settings and profile page. Have a partial backend
  -  for the other pages, and set up very basic networking capabilities.
- Final Full frontend, backend, and networking
  - Fully implement networking capabilities and have the frontend and backend working for all the pages which would include implementing the search feature, 
  - in-app messaging, and event creation and review pages.
- Stretch Goals
  - Sharing feature (iMessage, mail, Instagram, etc.)
  - Enhanced recommendation algorithm
  - In app group messaging


## Expanded Alpha Goals:
- Make all view controllers
- Broad UI for every page (broad means just get things to look good enough,  just add the basic buttons for the bare functioning of the app and navigation)
- Skeleton code for the main big parts of the app (search page/exploration, database/networking, event creation)
#### 16th Aim to be halfway to the alpha
- View controllers with segues for every page, no skeleton code, 
- Get at least some decent form of UI for every page
##### Questions for potential Alpha Goals
- Do we want to add constraints in currently for all of the UI layout? If not thats fine, but I think it shouldn't go later than the beta - Nick
- How much stylization and colorscheming do we want to do? - Nick
